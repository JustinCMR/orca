 *
 * Why this is a module helper rather than inlined at each call site: the guard
 * that clears `activeWorktreeId` before tearing down terminals isn't optional
 * polish — shutting down the active worktree while its TerminalPane is still
 * visible causes a visible "reboot" flicker and can crash the pane (PTY exit
 * callbacks race against the live xterm instance). See the original comment
 * in WorktreeContextMenu's handleCloseTerminals for the full reasoning.
 * Centralizing the sequence here keeps that safety invariant in one place so
 * a new caller can't accidentally skip it.
